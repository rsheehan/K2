A simple markup language.

Have a default theme.

The display area is 38x22 characters, except for verbatim screens.
This means that a line box can be drawn around the contents.
Then inside boxes, the normal display area is 36x(height - 2)

Theme colours for the whole presentation.
Theme: 
Values for the whole presentation start with "#"
#F/B: foreground/background ; this is for the whole slide

#TITLEBOX: characteristics including type, justification, colours

Colours
foreground/background

Slide: foreground background
Slide colours override this.
Viewport colours override this.
Text colours override this.

Types of boxes
None - just the interior Viewport
Line - mousetext outline, this takes up 2 extra lines (height)
and 2 extra characters (width) than the viewport
Solid - a filled character around the perimeter?
Solid/Line - both

Justifications
left, centre, right

Slide buildup
#BUILD
all - All at once
point - One by one

Bullet characters
diamond ([)
cross (])
openApple (A)
closedApple (@)
checkmark (D)
ellipsis (I)
hyphen (S)
arrow (U)

# Start of new slide followed by slide theme

	// Colours

	const BLACK			= 0
	const MAGENTA		= 1
	const DARK_BLUE		= 2
	const PURPLE		= 3
	const DARK_GREEN	= 4

	const YELLOW		= 13
	const AQUAMARINE	= 14
	const WHITE			= 15

_Underline_
The characters are underlined by mousetext L.
Need a "blank" line for underline of characters above.

Foreground colours
#COLOUR words in colour #
e.g. "The word #MAGENTAred# is magenta."

123455678901234556789012345567890123456 - maximum characters in a box
> Blockquotes for a paragraph are done 
> like this. They carry on without a 
> blank row.

A line
*------------------
is the mark of a new slide.
In practice, use at least 3 '-'.

Unordered lists
- one
- two
-- one
-- two
- three

or
. one
. two
.. one
.. two
. three
The '.'s get replaced by one mtxt '['.

# Type:line Just:centred
Box around text
#

The box characters are
    top char '_'
    bottom char mtxt 'L'
    left char mtxt 'Z'
    right char mtxt '_'

Turn ... into mtxt 'I'


\__to escape command characters

How to indicate a new slide?

Need to indicate verbatim mode.

==== Title (optional title)

Tab setting for indentation of levels
=|==|==|==|=========================
  
*-------------

Do I add extra spaces around text in titles and content boxes?
pro:
It looks neater, also it is possible most slides will want this,
therefore making the description text shorter. The extra spaces
do not need to be included.
con:
Less flexibility. If you don't want the extra spaces you are stuck.

* Could offer a parameter to choose. *


-----------------
Changed so that all boxes and tracks use the screen fg/bg colours.
So the routines just call putc.
